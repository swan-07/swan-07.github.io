I wanted to read Lacan for a long time though: how ironic that I end up finally reading it from a secondary source applying his theories - as it goes, the primary source doesn't exist, it's only the secondary source that does because knowledge is only knowledge when acknowledged by others."

The story also reminded me a bit of Bone. I couldn't help thinking how great the worldbuilding was, and how rich and deep the story was."

Pretty short and an easy read (smooth as butter, couldn't put it down). It took me about 3 hours in total and I finished it within the day, so it's a quick read too."

  category: "Book"
  thoughts: "It was a nice read. I'd heard a lot of references to it so it was satisfying to finally see their origin (I'm thinking in particular of the boot quote). Originally I had written here that I liked Animal Farm better, but (and maybe this is just due to the fact that I read 1984 more recently) after giving it some time I've found 1984's characters and world to be more memorable and poignant - not by their names, but by their characteristics and appearances. Julia with her red sash and scar is especially intruiging. I've been thinking about the Byronic heroine a lot lately and she's the second character I'd say would fit the trope, though not quite so either, due to her lack of power (really, everyone in the novel lacks power)."

  category: "Book"
  thoughts: "Very beautiful read, both in terms of the impressionist art and the story. The last page in particular is poignant and moving - 'The creatures outside looked from pig to man, and from man to pig, and from pig to man again, but already it was impossible to say which was which.' It's a pretty quick read (at least the graphic novel version, only around 30 min) so I'd recommend you to read it."

Another great thing about the book: concrete examples and suggestions."

One of the books I received from Non-Trivial (I received and read the Scout Mindset and the Precipice, too. The Precipice was really insightful though the footnote is super long, and the Scout Mindset was a shorter, sweet read.

The portrait he tells of his life in a vignette opening one of the later chapters is gut-wrenchingly sad and super poignant. Lots of people at my school said they didn't really get the court scene but I think it's pretty obvious that it's a metaphor for his internal struggle and didn't actually happen (or is a metaphor)?"
