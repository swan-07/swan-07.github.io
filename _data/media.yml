  thoughts: "A twist on a Bible story. Read for my Women's Lit class. The book was pretty engaging throughout. I get why we read it, since it showcases a varied cast of female characters, all with their own motivations and beliefs and all that are very much human. I listened to it in audiobook version."

  thoughts: "Yeah, this one's a comic. I read it because people kept saying it was good, and it was, though I wasn't left with a really strong impression of any of the characters. I liked the determinism they were playing with but it didn't really go anywhere much, except one part was really interesting (and reminded me of gwern's conclusion in timecrimes)."

  thoughts: "Another comic I read because people said it was good. It was, but it doesn't really kick off until you get a few chapters in, and it only stays good for a while. I was a little tired of it by the end (honestly by the brother plotline). I liked how the characters that seemed one off were continuously checked up upon so we could see how their stories unfolded though. Really good Chekov's gun-ing going on."

  thoughts: "An autobiography of sorts of a hacker. Makes physical pentesting sound really cool. There's not really technical stuff (at least in a modern context). Most of it is social engineering, but it's a nice story."

  category: "Book"
  thoughts: "My third Vonnegut story. I was inspired to read it after seeing a friend with 'Cat's Cradle' on his shirt. Listened to it as an audiobook. The ice-9 stuff in interesting and it has the Vonnegut style with all its idiosyncrasies that I liked in Slaughterhouse 9, but it drags on for a little long and I was kind of done with the story near the end."

  category: "Book"
  thoughts: "An amazing book that really teaches you and brings you into the history behind AI Alignment through engaging series of stories (I really liked the baby studies on attention and curiosity). One of the books I received from Non-Trivial (I received and read the Scout Mindset and the Precipice, too. The Precipice was really insightful though the footnote is super long, and the Scout Mindset was a shorter, sweet read. I gave my copy of the Scout Mindset to a friend at ASPR, since I couldn't bring all the books I had back home with me)."

  thoughts: "Listened to it as an audiobook during APUSH because I was curious what their defense was. Adams (or was it Hamilton?) really liked Greek and Roman references (similar to The Prince). Jay's essays were short and sweet, at least. I like Hamilton
  s point-by-point refutations."

  category: "Book"
  thoughts: "Read during APUSH because I wanted to see what kind of text could invigorate and entire nation. Honestly, it does a pretty good job! Paine is actually GOATed for this and The American Crisis, basically creating and saving the Revolution. Later on the text becomes a lot of stats, which reminded me of The Precipice."

  thoughts: "Yeah, I read it because I thought it would be funny to learn SQL from a manga. Well, it does a pretty good job. The plot's pretty straightforward, but the book suffers from having pages of text and diagrams after every manga excerpt (what's the point of tha manga if I have to read through text later on?)."

  thoughts: "Read for English class, but it's always a delight to get a chance to read an American classic. Super short and sweet to get through. The prose is wonderful in how it paints scenes and the middle is super romantic. The ending was also great. A fantastic story, but also has almost the exact same plot as Fitzgerald's earlier story, Winter Dreams."

  thoughts: "Read for junior year English class. I liked it, though I was a little annoyed by the main character's perception of women, and he's pretty unlikeable compared to the big brother. The portrait he tells of his life in a vignette opening one of the later chapters is gut-wrenchingly sad and super poignant. Lots of people at my school said they didn't really get the court scene but I think it's pretty obvious that it's a metaphor for his internal struggle and didn't actually happen (or is a metaphor)?"
