This summer was my first time in the UK (in all of Europe, actually)! We headed off for vacation on the 20th. Before we set off I bought some BBQ wings at Nick's Place, the pizza place near my house. I liked wings, and I liked BBQ (from ASPR) so I figured I would like them together. I kinda didn't though... they were too flavorful and soggy.

My relationship with flights has changed a lot. I used to hate flying when I was a child, but I've grown to like it now. One aspect is the lack of internet. I've had a problem with being constantly online (checking Discord, social media, etc.) and being bombarded with stimulation, so it's nice to relax and be cut off for a while. I also love flying because I've made it (and most long-distance forms of transportation) my time to read. I finished Atomic Habits on the plane and took a small nap, since due to time zones it would be 2 am ET when we arrived (time for sleep!) but 7 am BST (time for being awake and doing things).

Generally though, I love time zone changes, especially when I'm gaining time. In Taiwan my jetlag made me wake up at 5 am and sleep at 8 or 9, which is amazing. I was able to see the sun rise and sleep at a reasonable time. 

The last two flights I was on were ones where I went alone (first to Taiwan for ASPR and then to Michigan for Science Olympiad Nationals), so it was the first flight in a while with family. The food on both this flight and the one to Taiwan were great though! I don't know why people don't like airplane food. I think it tastes amazing. We were on a Delta plane (just like on my trip to Michigan), so once we left I asked the pilot for Delta trading cards to add to my collection. He handed me a shiny card for the Airbus A330 (I started collecting on my Michigan trip).

From the airport we were driven to our hotel, which was beautiful and had really comfy beds overflowing with pillows. The whole city of London was beautiful, with historical monuments and architecture everywhere. I was surprised at first that all the famous spots/tourist destinations were so close to each other that we could see a billion of them on a short ride from a sightseeing bus, but then I remembered Lexington also has a billion tourist spots. We took a boat that showed us around Big Ben and the London Eye.
