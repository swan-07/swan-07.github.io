Do you ever dream about flying? I do, and it's always pleasant. If I could be any non-human animal, I'd be a bird, just so I could fly. It's only natural: humans can run, swim, and dig, but they can't really fly by themselves.

I fell into an ornithopter rabbit hole a while ago. The physics behind all of it is really quite interesting - for example, did you know that the engines only serve to make the plane go forward really fast, and its the lift generated by the wing shape that actually brings the plane upwards? That's amazing. It was fun to walk through the Wright brothers' process. I found it intruiging that Leonardo da Vinci fell into the same rabbit hole that I did so many years ago.

But that's besides the point right now. One day I'd like to build a jetpack, but for now we can at least build some wings.

Of course, it wouldn't be fun to just have wings that sit there and look pretty. I want them to move! The simplest motion would be just a simple rotation. I had exactly no electrical engineering experience when I started this, so I learned what a servo was, and how to use it. This also means that if you want to follow along, you don't need much experience! It's all very intuitive. It's a little component that can turn, which is perfect for this. When learning, I found this Instructable: https://www.instructables.com/Motion-Activated-Cosplay-Wings-Using-Circuit-Playg/, which was really helpful. This instructable showed me that the wing turning mechanism itself wasn't that hard to do, and I ended up also using a backplate to hold all my materials.

Now, how do we control the wings? I didn't want to have to move them manually with my arms or hands, or program them to just flap every minute. If the wings were truly part of us, just like they are for birds, then we'd have to be able to control them with our brains. I found out what electroencephalograms (EEGs) were and how they worked (electrodes recorded the electrical activity in your brain using voltage differences caused by many many electrical impulses from neurons communicating). It's not the most precise, but it would be perfect for my purposes. Just one problem: as a high schooler, I didn't want to drop $100+ on an official EEG headset (though the price already being that low shows how amazing modern tech is), and I found this amazing tutorial that I followed: https://frontiernerds.com/brain-hack. The MindFlex game from Mattel has basically the same technology inside as official headsets, but you can get a new headband from the game (which is the part that you need and actually reads your brainwaves) for <$20 on Ebay, and plus, I thought it would be more fun to hack a headband to understand more about how it worked and get more hands-on experience with electrical engineering. 

The headband itself is typically part of a children's game, and as such is meant to be a black box. It doesn't actually give you any of the data from your brain, normally sending it to the other game components. We can fix that by modifying the headband! The frontiernerds article explains this in a lot more detail, but the two large pieces on either side of the headband are the containers for the EEG chip and the batteries respectively. The EEG chip has a T pin on the top that transmits the data, and a ground pin on the back that we can solder jumper wires to in order to connect the chip to an Arduino and send the data there instead. I had jumper wires from a kit that I received and barely touched from a camp in elementary school where we learned how to connect things on a breadboard.

I didn't even know how to unscrew and take apart the containers at first (a normal screwdriver was too big), but it turned out my dad had a set of mini screwdrivers that worked perfectly. Whenever I get surprised about something like this, I'm always reminded that my parents are people with depths beyond what I know about them. I think as children of parents we always think of our parents as beginning with us (because that's when we first began and met them) but they're so much more than that too. 

Anyways, now that I unscrewed the containers and saw the chip, I also saw how small the pins were, and I was a little nervous because I had never soldered before, and didn't have any equipment. I had visited a friend at MIT's Metropolis makerspace, where they told me that MIT's makerspaces couldn't take non-MIT students, but since I had a Harvard ID (I had finished my school's math curriculum and was taking Multivariable at Harvard Extension School this year instead) I could go to their Reef makerspace. 

I traveled back and forth there a few times where I got a safety orientation and met the person who ran the makerspace, who was really nice and showed me what all the different tools were and how to use them. I watched a few YouTube videos about soldering, and I felt I was ready. I adjusted the fume hood, moved the Helping Hands, heated up my soldering iron, snipped off a bit of solder, pressed the iron to the sponge, and readied myself when I saw the smoke. It was pretty difficult my first time, but I managed to get all my jumper wires soldered. On the ride home though, my wires fell out, and I also didn't like how I had to travel about 1 hour each way on the MBTA (Boston's public transport), going through at least 2 buses and walking for quite a while, to just get there. I needed to find a more accessible place.

When school started, I visited the Engineering and Robotics class teachers and asked them if they had a soldering iron. They said no, but I could check the robotics makerspace. I didn't even know that we HAD a robotics makerspace, but they told me who the advisor for robotics was, and he was my freshman year Python teacher! I found him during a free block, and he showed me where it was, and they did have a soldering kit! One of my friends in the robotics club just happened to walk in, and we soldered together (I was a little concerned that there was no fume hood, but it was probably fine).

I had talked a bit about soldering and a girl from my Physics class had given me some tips, but my wires still fell out again. I went back to the makerspace to resolder them during lunch, and I saw her there! She told me my issue was likely with the iron not being hot enough, so we turned up the temperature to >800 degrees F, and just like that it worked! This time, the wires were secure and didn't fall out. 

This year, I was also taking AP art, which gave me access to the art studio. I brought all my components to the art studio. The location was amazing, as I soon found out. They had access to so much stuff that was useful. (As a side note, AP art has been super fun this year! As part of a contemporary artist study, I even installed a https://deaddrops.com/ in my town - see if you can find it :D (hint: it's in an alleyway, near the bottom of a brick wall)).

August 3 - obsession with wings really started
materials:
- MindFlex headband (<$20)
- mini screwdriver
- AA Batteries x3
- Jumper wires (x9)
- soldering materials (iron + solder)
- servos (I bought a four pack from Amazon, $18)
- Arduino ()

Total time spent:
I worked on and off on this project the last two months. It was my first time trying this type of stuff out (Hack the North was within this time period) and I spent quite a bit of time on some dead ends and finding a place to be able to work that had the materials I needed. Since I didn't have access to some materials, lots of time was also spent waiting for things to ship, and I also spent time learning about the hardware and software and how everything worked. It took me about 50+ hours in total (not including my time spent doodling ideas and obsessively thinking about it), but if you already have a workstation and all the materials ready, as well as a clear plan of what you want to do, this is doable within a day (or a hackathon!).

Total Cost:
