I wonder how long it takes for someone to learn a new subject well enough to get good at it?

Luckily, I have a very structured opportunity! 

Recently, my Science Olympiad team qualified for Nationals in the first time in 20+ years. I will be doing the Material Science event. I have no prior experience in material science, I have taken no classes and I don't know a single thing about the event yet. This event is also new to my partner. I will document my studies and the time it takes here, and we'll see how I do! A nice marker of my progress can be my placement at Nationals.
