I was recently gifted a bean plant by a friend.

Let's see how it grows!

Day 0 (3/20/25):
My friend gifted me a bean plant. She had two: one was red and one was black. I'm not sure which one mine is, but we can find out :)

I accidentally spilled the soil a little when leaving the library. Hopefully that won't affect anything. I think I'll call my bean plant Fred.

Google says that I should keep my beans in view of the sun, it will take them 8-10 days to germinate (assuming these are red beans), and that I should water them every 2-3 days. My friend said she watered them today. 

I also kept the bean plant in the dark Science Olympiad closet for an hour during last block because I needed to store it somewhere...
