    <h1>Lexington Sprouts</h1>
<p>22 Aug 2024 - stephanie</p>

<p>Another summer, another year of LexSprouts. Oh, I really should say AlltheSprouts now, since we’re no longer just in Lexington. Hopkinton opened their branch recently.</p>

<p>Science Outdoors went smoothly, as usual. We opened up registration, received a bunch of responses, then went through all of them to narrow down our list to 10-15 students. We booked a room in the Community Center and prepared lesson plans. With 5 teachers to switch between, no one felt overwhelmed and we got to teach everything that we felt was fun (science mainly, hence the course name, but I also got a lockpicking lecture in there too!)</p>

<p>The last day went great. The students loved the competition, and we also ordered pizza and candy.</p>

<p>Slice of Art went well, also! I taught a few classes to the kids, starting with still life (an apple), the human figure, then portrait.</p>
