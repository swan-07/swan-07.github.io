    <h1>Media I've Consumed</h1>
<p>it says book list and most of these will be books, but there's other media in here too. i started recording in August 2024</p>
<div class="media-list">
  
  <div class="media-item" data-category="Short Story" title="My first short story of 2025. The twist was pretty unexpected (though in retrospect, I should've seen it coming) but it makes you think it's going to go in a completely different way. Great sci-fi, works really well as a short story, and explores interesting philosophical questions." datefinished="Jan 4 2025">
    <strong>Learning to Be Me</strong> (Short Story) - Finished Jan 4 2025
  </div>
  
  <div class="media-item" data-category="Book" title="My first book of 2025! Nice book, good dystopia for the modern age. Especially good if you're tech-adjacent." datefinished="Jan 2 2025">
    <strong>The Circle</strong> (Book) - Finished Jan 2 2025
  </div>
  
  <div class="media-item" data-category="Short Book" title="I read it because I saw it referred to on a blog post (that I found from MAKE magazine) about turning a toy car into a VR RC car. I'll try to make my own soon, and since they didn't have detailed instructions or code I'll need to learn how it works, which is why I'm starting with their beginner book." datefinished="Dec 19 2024">
    <strong>Introduction to JavaScript Electronics</strong> (Short Book) - Finished Dec 19 2024
  </div>
  
  <div class="media-item" data-category="Book" title="Read for Women's Literature class. Honestly, this isn't that bad to get through! It was a pretty interesting and engaging story, in fact. I might need to give Pride and Prejudice another chance - last time, I read it in freshman year and couldn't finish it." datefinished="Dec 18 2024">
    <strong>Jane Eyre</strong> (Book) - Finished Dec 18 2024
  </div>
  
  <div class="media-item" data-category="Book" title="Really interesting book, I liked reading it. I loved the setting and premise of a hedonistic world. The value-adjustment at conception is also interesting to think about. Pretty short and an easy read (smooth as butter, couldn't put it down). It took me about 3 hours in total and I finished it within the day, so it's a quick read too." datefinished="Dec 6 2024">
    <strong>Brave New World</strong> (Book) - Finished Dec 6 2024
  </div>
  
  <div class="media-item" data-category="Short Story" title="Ted Chiang's work is always fun. It's sci-fi with a thick coat of linguistics on it. My English teacher loved it, and I think it's pretty neat too. You can see the similarities with some of his other work that I like, such as Story of Your Life." datefinished="Dec 5 2024">
    <strong>The Truth of Fact, The Truth of Feeling</strong> (Short Story) - Finished Dec 5 2024
  </div>
  
  <div class="media-item" data-category="Book" title="It was a nice read. I'd heard a lot of references to it so it was satisfying to finally see their origin (I'm thinking in particular of the boot quote). Originally I had written here that I liked Animal Farm better, but (and maybe this is just due to the fact that I read 1984 more recently) after giving it some time I've found 1984's characters and world to be more memorable and poignant - not by their names, but by their characteristics and appearances. Julia with her red sash and scar is especially intruiging. I've been thinking about the Byronic heroine a lot lately and she's the second character I'd say would fit the trope, though not quite so either, due to her lack of power (really, everyone in the novel lacks power)." datefinished="Dec 5 2024">
    <strong>1984 - The Graphic Novel</strong> (Book) - Finished Dec 5 2024
  </div>
  
  <div class="media-item" data-category="Book" title="Very beautiful read, both in terms of the impressionist art and the story. The last page in particular is poignant and moving - 'The creatures outside looked from pig to man, and from man to pig, and from pig to man again, but already it was impossible to say which was which.' It's a pretty quick read (at least the graphic novel version, only around 30 min) so I'd recommend you to read it." datefinished="Dec 4 2024">
    <strong>Animal Farm - The Graphic Novel</strong> (Book) - Finished Dec 4 2024
  </div>
  
  <div class="media-item" data-category="Book" title="Interesting and I learned a lot about the history and general field, but after reading Beauvoir's work it seems like this book is just a simplified version of that (which I guess is its purpose). If you want your deeper questions answered, go read The Second Sex." datefinished="Sep 10 2024">
    <strong>Think Like a Feminist - Hay</strong> (Book) - Finished Sep 10 2024
  </div>
  
  <div class="media-item" data-category="Other" title="The full YouTube series... I think it was fun and I learned a lot about things around me that I didn't know before, but due to spending only one episode on each subject it loses some of its depth to breadth, so the majority of what you learned was pretty shallow." datefinished="Sep 2 2024">
    <strong>Crash Course Engineering</strong> (Other) - Finished Sep 2 2024
  </div>
  
  <div class="media-item" data-category="Book" title="Short and nice to read, felt like I was just going through a few blog posts." datefinished="Sep 1 2024">
    <strong>Freakonomics - Dubner</strong> (Book) - Finished Sep 1 2024
  </div>
  
  <div class="media-item" data-category="Book" title="Nice scifi story. Nell's Primer story is very reminiscent of Barbie's dream in Sandman, or perhaps Alice in Wonderland/The Phantom Tollbooth/Narnia. Maybe it is just the style of dream of little girls. It is lovely to see in real time adventure and life become myth. The ending left me a little unsatisfied though." datefinished="Aug 30 2024">
    <strong>The Diamond Age - Stephenson</strong> (Book) - Finished Aug 30 2024
  </div>
  
  <div class="media-item" data-category="Book" title="Read in ~2 hours on my flight to London. Very engaging and easy as butter and twice as smooth to get through, similar to Superforecasting. The subject matter is also really engaging, since I've been struggling with bad habits with social media and health, so I'm going to try implementing some of the suggestions. Another great thing about the book: concrete examples and suggestions." datefinished="Aug 21 2024">
    <strong>Atomic Habits - Clear</strong> (Book) - Finished Aug 21 2024
  </div>
  
  <div class="media-item" data-category="Book" title="A twist on a Bible story. Read for my Women's Lit class. The book was pretty engaging throughout. I get why we read it, since it showcases a varied cast of female characters, all with their own motivations and beliefs and all that are very much human. I listened to it in audiobook version." datefinished="Aug 2024">
    <strong>The Red Tent - Diamant</strong> (Book) - Finished Aug 2024
  </div>
  
  <div class="media-item" data-category="Book" title="An autobiography of sorts of a hacker. Makes physical pentesting sound really cool. There's not really technical stuff (at least in a modern context). Most of it is social engineering, but it's a nice story." datefinished="July 2024">
    <strong>Ghost in the Wires - Mitnick</strong> (Book) - Finished July 2024
  </div>
  
  <div class="media-item" data-category="Book" title="My third Vonnegut story. I was inspired to read it after seeing a friend with 'Cat's Cradle' on his shirt. Listened to it as an audiobook. The ice-9 stuff in interesting and it has the Vonnegut style with all its idiosyncrasies that I liked in Slaughterhouse 5, but it drags on for a little long and I was kind of done with the story near the end." datefinished="July 2024">
    <strong>Cat's Cradle - Vonnegut</strong> (Book) - Finished July 2024
  </div>
  
  <div class="media-item" data-category="Movie" title="A classic sci-fi movie. I hosted a movie night at BWSI and this is the movie someone recommended to watch. It was really good, actually. Kind of like Home Alone." datefinished="July 2024">
    <strong>War Games - Badham</strong> (Movie) - Finished July 2024
  </div>
  
  <div class="media-item" data-category="Book" title="Cute, short, and sweet children's book. 'Alice in Wonderland' but for math kids instead of cs kids. The rhetoric is funny and the book is easy to get through." datefinished="July 2024">
    <strong>The Phantom Tollbooth - Juster</strong> (Book) - Finished July 2024
  </div>
  
  <div class="media-item" data-category="Book" title="An amazing book that really teaches you and brings you into the history behind AI Alignment through engaging series of stories (I really liked the baby studies on attention and curiosity). One of the books I received from Non-Trivial (I received and read the Scout Mindset and the Precipice, too. The Precipice was really insightful though the footnote is super long, and the Scout Mindset was a shorter, sweet read. I gave my copy of the Scout Mindset to a friend at ASPR, since I couldn't bring all the books I had back home with me)." datefinished="June 2024">
    <strong>The Alignment Problem - Christian</strong> (Book) - Finished June 2024
  </div>
  
  <div class="media-item" data-category="Book" title="Fun book for learning NetLogo and the basics of simulations. Read during ASPR - this was one of the books on the book table." datefinished="Pre-Summer 2024">
    <strong>Modeling Social Behavior - Smaldino</strong> (Book) - Finished Pre-Summer 2024
  </div>
  
  <div class="media-item" data-category="Other" title="Listened to it as an audiobook during APUSH because I was curious what their defense was. Adams (or was it Hamilton?) really liked Greek and Roman references (similar to The Prince). Jay's essays were short and sweet, at least. I like Hamilton s point-by-point refutations." datefinished="Pre-Summer 2024">
    <strong>The Federalist Papers</strong> (Other) - Finished Pre-Summer 2024
  </div>
  
  <div class="media-item" data-category="Book" title="Read during APUSH because I wanted to see what kind of text could invigorate and entire nation. Honestly, it does a pretty good job! Paine is actually GOATed for this and The American Crisis, basically creating and saving the Revolution. Later on the text becomes a lot of stats, which reminded me of The Precipice." datefinished="Pre-Summer 2024">
    <strong>Common Sense - Paine</strong> (Book) - Finished Pre-Summer 2024
  </div>
  
  <div class="media-item" data-category="Book" title="I wrote a book review on my old blog that you can look at. Very analogy-heavy in the first part (and the part that everyone remembers since it's more interesting). The second part gets into stats and reminds me of The Precipice" datefinished="Pre-Summer 2024">
    <strong>The Prince - Machiavelli</strong> (Book) - Finished Pre-Summer 2024
  </div>
  
  <div class="media-item" data-category="Book" title="Reading during flight back from ASPR, was short and fun to read." datefinished="Pre-Summer 2024">
    <strong>Superforecasting - Gardner</strong> (Book) - Finished Pre-Summer 2024
  </div>
  
  <div class="media-item" data-category="Book" title="Interesting analysis of different existential risks. Very flowery and persuasive start, then it becomes a more engaging research meta-analysis. The footnotes are super long and stat heavy." datefinished="Pre-Summer 2024">
    <strong>The Precipice - Ord</strong> (Book) - Finished Pre-Summer 2024
  </div>
  
  <div class="media-item" data-category="Other" title="Yeah, I read it because I thought it would be funny to learn SQL from a manga. Well, it does a pretty good job. The plot's pretty straightforward, but the book suffers from having pages of text and diagrams after every manga excerpt (what's the point of tha manga if I have to read through text later on?)." datefinished="Pre-Summer 2024">
    <strong>The Manga Guide to Databases - Takahashi</strong> (Other) - Finished Pre-Summer 2024
  </div>
  
  <div class="media-item" data-category="Book" title="A famous classic and interesting read on interpersonal relationships." datefinished="Pre-Summer 2024">
    <strong>Lord of the Flies - Golding</strong> (Book) - Finished Pre-Summer 2024
  </div>
  
  <div class="media-item" data-category="Book" title="Read for English class, but it's always a delight to get a chance to read an American classic. Super short and sweet to get through. The prose is wonderful in how it paints scenes and the middle is super romantic. The ending was also great. A fantastic story, but also has almost the exact same plot as Fitzgerald's earlier story, Winter Dreams." datefinished="Pre-Summer 2024">
    <strong>The Great Gatsby - Fitzgerald</strong> (Book) - Finished Pre-Summer 2024
  </div>
  
  <div class="media-item" data-category="Other" title="This is a really fun coding challenge! You know how some people have Advent calendars? This is an advent calendar of coding challenges, where you get a new one each day! It was really fun and I ended up doing all of them (thought not all on their proper days). It was fun to see my landscape get created as I solved more challenges." datefinished="Pre-Summer 2024">
    <strong>Advent of Code 2024</strong> (Other) - Finished Pre-Summer 2024
  </div>
  
  <div class="media-item" data-category="Book" title="Read for English class. It was really great, and like many good dystopian books the situation was purposefully infuriating. I was really sad at the ending." datefinished="Pre-Summer 2024">
    <strong>The Crucible - Miller</strong> (Book) - Finished Pre-Summer 2024
  </div>
  
  <div class="media-item" data-category="Book" title="Read for English class. It was interesting, and I enjoyed a book set in Boston since all the settings seemed familiar." datefinished="Pre-Summer 2024">
    <strong>The Namesake - Lahiri</strong> (Book) - Finished Pre-Summer 2024
  </div>
  
  <div class="media-item" data-category="Book" title="History of Nike. It's an interesting read to see how Nike was built up." datefinished="Pre-Summer 2024">
    <strong>Shoe Dog - Knight</strong> (Book) - Finished Pre-Summer 2024
  </div>
  
  <div class="media-item" data-category="Book" title="Read for junior year English class. I liked it, though I was a little annoyed by the main character's perception of women, and he's pretty unlikeable compared to the big brother. The portrait he tells of his life in a vignette opening one of the later chapters is gut-wrenchingly sad and super poignant. Lots of people at my school said they didn't really get the court scene but I think it's pretty obvious that it's a metaphor for his internal struggle and didn't actually happen (or is a metaphor)?" datefinished="Pre-Summer 2024">
    <strong>Interior Chinatown - Yu</strong> (Book) - Finished Pre-Summer 2024
  </div>
  
  <div class="media-item" data-category="Book" title="Read because the book was popular. The writing is really good, and it was easy as butter to get through. It helps that the story is super engaging, but Palahniuk's prose is seriously great." datefinished="Pre-Summer 2024">
    <strong>Fight Club - Palahniuk</strong> (Book) - Finished Pre-Summer 2024
  </div>
  
  <div class="media-item" data-category="Book" title="Read for junior year APUSH. It's actually super interesting, about beginning of the settlement of the US. It's cool to see the beginning." datefinished="Pre-Summer 2024">
    <strong>Mayflower</strong> (Book) - Finished Pre-Summer 2024
  </div>
  
  <div class="media-item" data-category="Book" title="A story of a university student learning about his grandfather. I like how it flips between the present and the past. The grandfather's story is much more interesting than the student's, but at least we get to learn some cool set theory and theories about infinity with him!" datefinished="Pre-Summer 2024">
    <strong>A Certain Ambiguity - Suri</strong> (Book) - Finished Pre-Summer 2024
  </div>
  
  <div class="media-item" data-category="Book" title="Read for sophomore year AP WH. Really interesting and also makes me sad for teosinte (corn)." datefinished="Pre-Summer 2024">
